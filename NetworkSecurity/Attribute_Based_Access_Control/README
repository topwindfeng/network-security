If a doctor requests to access patients' data, the system needs to check out what authority the doctor has.
1. Fill out three request forms(RequestID, RequestPassword, RequestWorkplace).
2. Launch Run. If the Doctor is not registered or the given information is wrong, Nothing shows up. If information is correct, the program will output 2 files. One is file Authority indicating the doctor's authority(1 = Primary Doctor, 2 = Secondary Doctor, 3 = Unauthorized). Another is file ID contains Doctor's ID.
3. If three request forms are modified, you need to relaunch Run to regenerate the corresponding outputs(Authority, ID).
